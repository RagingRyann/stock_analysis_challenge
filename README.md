# Analyzing Stocks with VBA

## Overview

### Purpose

<br>
After Steve saved his parents from a bad investment in DQ stocks, he wondered if the dataset were capable of covering more. I refactored the original code to include the entire stock market for analysis over the past couple years. One of my main goals was to make sure the code ran as efficiently as possible even with more to cover. <br>
